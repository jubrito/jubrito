Since I was a child, I have witnessed injustice among socioeconomic classes and inequality between men and women. Knowing the future would be guided by the presence of technology, I completed a degree in Information Systems at the University of São Paulo (EACH-USP) to do my part and help the world be a fairer place.

I founded a Science Club for Girls inside the University named “Lab das Minas” and acted as the coordinator, designer, and monitor, holding weekly meetings in the East Zone of São Paulo. 

We encouraged young females to adjust their male-dominated stereotyped views of the technological field, providing them a safe environment with tools to create codes and experiments. We aimed to prevent their gender and financial situation from hampering their path to become programmers and scientists. Now, my long-term goal is to achieve the same equality and female involvement worldwide.

Besides having two years of experience as a front-end developer, I have dedicated my studies to full-stack and mobile technologies, as the understanding of the big picture provides me with tools to understand the complete system and write code more efficiently (but also because I find it very interesting) ;) 

With my belief in technology as a tool for social transformation, I keep myself motivated to continue evolving my knowledge on the field to identify opportunities to impact society and the environment positively.
